# Nuclear War card game research bundle

Created for building a research-grade simulation of Douglas Malewicki's *Nuclear War* card game family.

This bundle collects public-source material, downloaded PDFs where available, structured source indexes, rule summaries, card inventories, variant notes, simulation schema, and AI prompts/memories for continuing the reconstruction work.

## Important legal/provenance note

This is a research bundle. It distinguishes:

- **Official/current materials**: presently hosted by Mr. B Games for *Nuclear Destruction*, the current Nuclear War-family release.
- **Official-derived or public mirrors**: rules/card-list/FAQ material found on third-party sites. These may preserve older Flying Buffalo-era text but are not necessarily hosted by the current rights holder.
- **Community/fan material**: BoardGameGeek wiki notes, postal-play rules, player guides, Tabletop Simulator implementations, and combined-rule compilations.
- **Tertiary/contextual material**: Wikipedia, reviews, museum records, news articles, and nuclear-wargaming scholarship.

Exact card wording and card art remain rights-restricted. For simulation, use the `effect_summary` fields and replace them with verified exact card text only from your legal physical copy or publisher-authorized sources. Do not redistribute card art or full card text without permission.

## Most useful folders

- `99_sources/downloaded_pdfs/` - downloaded PDFs successfully captured.
- `99_sources/extracted_text/` - text extracted from downloaded PDFs when possible.
- `99_sources/source_notes/` - notes for sources that could not be downloaded as raw HTML/PDF.
- `source_index.csv` / `source_index.json` - full source catalog.
- `03_card_data/` - structured card inventories and confidence notes.
- `04_simulation_model/` - state model, rules engine spec, randomizer tables, and variant modules.
- `05_ai_prompts_and_memories/` - ready-to-use prompts/memory text for future AI work.
- `07_gaps_and_next_steps/` - exact-text and edition-reconciliation checklist.

## Captured source materials

Successfully downloaded:

1. Official Mr. B Games *Nuclear Destruction* rules PDF.
2. Official Mr. B Games *Nuclear Destruction* anti-missile chart PDF.
3. Official Mr. B Games *Nuclear Destruction* game log PDF.
4. Public mirror of a later/base *Nuclear War* rules PDF using two ten-sided dice.
5. Public scan of an older spinner-era *Nuclear War* rule sheet.

HTML pages and dynamic sites were captured as URL-indexed source notes rather than raw HTML because the downloader available in this environment reliably fetched PDFs but not HTML pages.

## Recommended workflow

1. Use `source_index.csv` to identify the source you want.
2. Use `02_rules_and_variants/rules_reconstruction_summary.md` for the unified rules map.
3. Use `03_card_data/base_game_card_inventory.csv` as the first-pass base deck manifest.
4. Use `04_simulation_model/rules_engine_spec.md` and `04_simulation_model/spinner_and_die_tables.json` to implement rules.
5. Use `07_gaps_and_next_steps/exact_text_gap_list.md` when transcribing exact text from your physical copy.
